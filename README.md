# CEPARCO-Integrating-Project
In Milestone 2, we were able to create the DFT and IDFT logic in C programming. In this
final project update, we will discuss the last part of the project: the implementation of FWHT and
IFWHT in CUDA. We also implemented FWHT & IFWHT in Matlab to compare the speed between
Matlab and CUDA. Lastly, we tried using the DFT & IDFT built-in functions in Matlab, and see
if it is faster than CUDA. 

## Comparison of Execution Time (in ms, average of 5 loops):
### A. C Sequential 
#### 2 ^ 20
